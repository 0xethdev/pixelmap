                        In the vast expanse of the internet, a unique convergence of art and technology takes form as _mosaix. This project isn't just a collection of digital pixels; it's a bold exploration of how we create, share, and value art in the blockchain era.

                        At the heart of _mosaix lies a digital canvas that challenges traditional notions of art. Here, every pixel carries the potential for expression, set against a backdrop of Ethereum's blockchain. It's a space where the community's imagination shapes the evolving masterpiece, reflecting a diverse tapestry of thoughts and visions. Every pixel is a piece of a larger narrative shaped by the collective will of its creators

                        _mosaix introduces a nuanced approach to ownership through Harberger taxes. It's a concept that breathes life into the digital canvas, allowing pixels to change hands in a way that ensures they always land in the hands artists that value them most. This mechanism not only democratizes creation but also ensures that the canvas remains a fluid tapestry of current expressions and ideas.

                        The rhythm of _mosaix is marked by alternating periods of artistic freedom and collective decision-making. In the artistic phase, creators have three days to imbue the canvas with their vision, selecting from a palette of colors and shapes for each pixel. What follows is a day of choice and decision making, where the fate of the collective artwork is put to a vote: to mint the collective artwork as an NFT, storing the resulting image directly on-chain and immortalizing a moment of collective achievement, or to begin anew, embracing the ever-changing nature of artistic endeavor.

                        Success in the vote triggers an auction, transforming the digital mosaic into a valuable NFT. Proceeds are distributed among the pixel owners, aligning financial incentives with creative contributions. This cycle of creation, appreciation, and reward encapsulates the essence of _mosaix, where art means shared culture and ideas, and ownership extends beyond possession to participation.
